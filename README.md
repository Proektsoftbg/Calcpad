# Calcpad

Calcpad is free software for mathematical and engineering calculations, developed by Proektsoft EOOD. It represents a flexible and modern programmable calculator with Html report generator. It is simple and easy to use, but it also includes many advanced features:

* real and complex numbers;</li>
* units of measurement (SI, Imperial and USCS);</li>
* custom variables;</li>
* built-in library with common math functions;</li>
* custom functions of multiple parameters f(x; y; z; ...);</li>
* powerful numerical methods for root and extremum finding, numerical integration and differentiation;</li>
* finite sum, product and iteration procedures;</li>
* program flow control with conditions and loops;</li>
* "titles" and 'text' comments in quotes;</li> 
* support for Html and CSS in comments for rich formatting;</li>
* function plotting, images, tables, parametric SVG drawings, etc.;</li>
* automatic generation of Html forms for data input;</li>
* professional looking Html reports for viewing printing;</li>
* variable substitution and smart rounding of numbers;</li> 
* output visibility control and content folding;</li>
* support for plain text (*.txt, *.cpd) and binary (*.cpdz) file formats.</li>

This software is developed using the C# programming language and the latest computer technologies. It automatically parses the input, substitutes the variables, calculates the expressions and displays the output. All results are sent to a professional looking Html report for viewing and printing.

## Fields of application
This software is suitable for engineers and other professionals that need to perform repetitive calculations and present them in official documentation such as calculation notes. They can automate this task efficiently by creating powerful and reliable Calcpad worksheets. It can also help teachers to prepare calculation examples, papers, manuals, books etc. Students can use it to solve various problems, prepare homeworks, phd theses etc.

## Installation
The installation is performed by the automated setup program [calcpad-setup-en-x64.exe](https://github.com/Proektsoftbg/Calcpad/blob/main/Setup/calcpad-setup-en-x64.exe). Follow the instruction of the setup wizard. The software requires a 64 bit computer with Windows 10 and [Microsoft .NET 6.0](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/a865ccae-2219-4184-bcd6-0178dc580589/ba452d37e8396b7a49a9adc0e1a07e87/windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.0-win-x64.exe).
